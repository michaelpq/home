# Account information
set from = "john@doe.com"
set realname = "John Doe"
set imap_user = "john@example.com"

# Signature
set signature = "echo $realname |"

# Password information
#set imap_pass = "My_password"
# Uncomment and edit this trick if you do not want to store this
# password as static data on your computer.
#set imap_pass = `getpassword email_id`
# Storing passwords with gpg2 is safer
# 1) Generate a key (name John Doe for example):
# $ gpg2 --gen-key
# 2) Create a file with password like that (can be multiple):
# $ cat $HOME/password_blank.txt
# set my_mutt_passwd = my_wonderful_password
# 3) Encrypt the blank password file with gpg2, generating here
#    $HOME/password_blank.txt.gpg
# $ gpg2 -e -r "John Doe" $HOME/password_blank.txt
# 4) Source it in configuration file of mutt (actually uncomment here):
#source "gpg2 -dq ~/.mutt/mutt_pass.gpg |"
# 5) Use the variable set in gpg file (uncomment here):
#set smtp_pass = $my_mutt_passwd

# Mail box settings
# Uncomment the following section for a local box
#set mbox_type = maildir
#set mbox = "~/mail/inbox/"
#set spoolfile = "~/mail/inbox/"
#set folder = "~/mail/"
#set record = "~/mail/sent/"
#set postponed = "~/mail/postponed/"

# Uncomment this section for a remote box
#set folder = "imaps://imap.example.com:993"
#set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
#set mbox = "+INBOX"
#set postponed = "+Drafts"
#set record = "+Sent"

# Uncomment this section for a gmail account
#set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com:993"
#set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
#set postponed = "+[Gmail]/Drafts"
# Setting up record will result in duplicate emails as Gmail saves all
# entries automatically. It is actually recommended to directly unset
# it when using multiple boxes to avoid any overlapping.
#set record = "+[Gmail]/Sent Mail"
#unset record

# SMTP Setup (normal or secured)
set smtp_url = "smtp://johnr@smtp.example.com:587/"

# password as static data on your computer.
#set smtp_pass=`getpassword email_id`

# here needs to match the one set in msmtprc.
