# pg_indent
#	Indent automatically PostgreSQL code, compiling all the needed tools
#	at the same time.

#
#	This is used for programming purposes, and is a small wrapper on top
#	of the in-core tool called pgindent which should be used before commit
#	to sanitize the code created.

# Immediately leave in case of failure and avoid using unassigned
