# pg_indent
#	Indent automatically PostgreSQL code, compiling all the needed tools
#	at the same time.

#
#	This is used for programming purposes, and is a small wrapper on top
#	of the in-core tool called pgindent which should be used before commit
#	to sanitize the code created.

# Immediately leave in case of failure and avoid using unassigned
# variables.

# Move to the root of the Postgres tree

# Compile pg_bsd_indent which is used for the indentation.

# And now indent PostgreSQL code, which needs to happen from the root of
# the source tree.

# Indent the perl code.  This needs to happen as well from the root of
# the source tree, and has a dependency with perltidy.

# Run perlcritic and check state of the code while on it.
